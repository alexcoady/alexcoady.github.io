Ray-Ban's &#35;Campaign4Change Tumblr is an interactive micro-site that lets users tear through a series of images and messaging until they find a phrase that represents their *campaign for change*.

The bottom or the top image can be torn away to reveal a new message:

![Before tearing]({{ "/sample.jpg" | prepend: page.slug | prepend: page.imagesrc | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Users can continue to tear until they find a message they agree with:

![Tearing]({{ "/tear.jpg" | prepend: page.slug | prepend: page.imagesrc | prepend: site.baseurl }})

When the user finds one they like, they can share it on download the file to their computer:

![Sharing on facebook]({{ "/facebook.jpg" | prepend: page.slug | prepend: page.imagesrc | prepend: site.baseurl }})
