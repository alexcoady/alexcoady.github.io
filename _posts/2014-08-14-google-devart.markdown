DevArt by Google Creative Lab is powered by developers making art using code. The concept is that users sign in with their GitHub accounts, fork a repository that acts as a template, and work on their repository as an entry to the competition.

Submissions were then judged by Google and artists including [Zach Lieberman](https://twitter.com/zachlieberman) and [Karsten Schmidt](https://twitter.com/toxi). The winner was then commissioned by Google to develop their concept into an installtation at the Barbican's [Digital Revolution](http://www.barbican.org.uk/digital-revolution) exhibition in September 2014.

### The tech side

Because this is a Google project, we used Angular on the front-end, and App Engine on the back-end. The combination of these was a first at Stinkdigital, and the learning curve was steep.

The front-end developers had all used Javascript platforms such as Backbone before, but Angular was different and required a different way of working. Everyone agreed that it was a good choice of technology towards the end of the project, and the combination has been used a number of times on other projects.
