Google DevArt was my first project at Stinkdigital, and introduction to using *Angular.js* for a site in production. Users are encouraged to sign-in with their GitHub accounts and enter a competition to win funding for an installation at the Barbican Centre during the [Digital revolutions](http://www.barbican.org.uk/digital-revolution) exhibition.
