# My name's Alex Coady

### I'm a front-end developer based in London

I've worked at a few brilliant agencies, most recently Stinkdigital, where I've been involved with, and led projects for Honda, Google creative lab and Strava to name a few.

My main areas of technical expertise are:

- Vanilla Javascript (ES2015/6)
- Front-end frameworks (Backbone, Angular, React/Redux)
- HTML & CSS (Sass, Stylus, Rework, BEM)
- Node.js server development (Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, Jade)
- Progressive enhancement
